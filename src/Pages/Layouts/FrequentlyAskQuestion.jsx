                        the starting day.

                    <p>If you need to get a permit to install your fence, 
                        ask to find out whether that responsibility falls
                        to you or whether itâ€™s something the contractor handles.
                        If a contractor asks you to pull the permit, buyer beware. 
                        This may be because they are not licensed, insured, and 
                        approved by the municipality.

                    <summary>Are you insured and licensed?</summary>
                    <p>We have the appropriate license and 
                        insurance and we will be able to provide proof of 
                        both. Using a contractor that is not licensed or 
                        insured can leave you open to liability if they 
                        cause damage or get hurt.
