            <p>Usually, the fence is ready to be installed one month after 
                the starting day.

            <summary>Who handle the permitting process? </summary>
            <p>If you need to get a permit to install your fence, 
                ask to find out whether that responsibility falls
                to you or whether itâ€™s something the contractor handles.
                If a contractor asks you to pull the permit, buyer beware. 
                This may be because they are not licensed, insured, and 
                approved by the municipality.
            </p>

        <details className='items'>
            <summary>Are you insured and licensed?</summary>
            <p>We have the appropriate license and 
                insurance and we will be able to provide proof of 
                both. Using a contractor that is not licensed or 
                insured can leave you open to liability if they 
                cause damage or get hurt.
